## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
## Results 
•	June average temperature is 75, while December is only 3 degrees lower than it. 
•	The temperature fluctuates a little bit more in December since the standard deviation in December is higher than that in June 
•	The max and min temperature in June are 85 and 64, while those in December are 83 and 56.

## Summary 
In summary, although the temperatures in December are lower than those in June, the weather is just a little bit colder in December. Surf and ice-cream business should be sustainable as people may still want to come for summer activities. 
### More Queries 
I would recommend using the same logic to run two queries by filtering precipitation data in June and December to see if the weather conditions are stable besides the temperature.
